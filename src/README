This Soccer Game is designed in a Observer pattern, which Robot objects are observers of the SoccerBall object.
When the SoccerBall changes positions, all robots are notified and robots can react accordingly.
Player function class is designed in a Strategy pattern so that each play style can be implemented in further details with abstraction from the interface.
